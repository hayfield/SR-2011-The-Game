A score attack game based on the Student Robotics Competition 2011 https://www.studentrobotics.org/

The rules are as-per the competition, with the one change being that rounds are 60 seconds long rather than 180.

The game is created in Unity http://unity3d.com/

A Webplayer build which allows the game to be played in your web browser is available under /WebPlayer/WebPlayer.html
