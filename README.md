A score attack game based on the [Student Robotics](https://www.studentrobotics.org/) Competition 2011.

The rules are as-per the competition, with the one change being that rounds are 60 seconds long rather than 180.

The game is created in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

A Webplayer build which allows the game to be played in your web browser is available under /WebPlayer/WebPlayer.html or can be played online [here](http://hayfield.github.com/student-robotics/2011/game/game.html).
